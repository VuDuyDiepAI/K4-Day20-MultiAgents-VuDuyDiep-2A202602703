name: discover-output-conventions
description: Use when the required output format or naming conventions are not fully stated in the task description.
---
1. Search the workspace and any provided checker or validator scripts for stated conventions before writing output.
2. Extract explicit rules: required file paths, top-level keys, schema version fields, sort order, and naming normalisation.
3. Apply naming normalisation consistently everywhere the name appears, including aggregate keys.
4. Apply the required sort order to every list in the output, not just the primary one.
5. Include any required metadata block (schema version, generator name) exactly as specified.
6. Run the provided checker or validator against the produced output and read every check result.
7. If a check fails, fix the output and re-run the checker until all checks pass.
8. Completion check: checker reports all checks passed and the output file is present at the required path.
