description: Use when a test suite has failing tests and you need to diagnose and repair the underlying code.
---
1. Run the full suite once and capture the complete failure output to a file; do not re-run with narrow line slices.
2. Read each failure's traceback top-to-bottom: identify the exact function, the input value, and the expected vs actual behaviour.
3. Read the docstring and any type hints of the failing function before editing; the docstring is the contract.
4. Fix one failure at a time, then re-run only the affected test to confirm, then the full suite.
5. When a helper is shared, check every caller of the changed function still behaves correctly.
6. Handle all documented input formats, not just the one in the failing example (e.g. separators, parentheses for negatives, mixed case).
7. For numeric rounding, follow the stated rounding mode explicitly rather than relying on language defaults.
8. For ordering requirements, apply the documented sort key and tie-breakers exactly.
9. For serialization/quoting requirements, follow the documented format rather than a library default.
Completion checks:
- Full suite passes with zero failures.
- Every public function has type annotations on all parameters and the return value.
- A regression test file exists with at least one test per fixed bug and it passes.
- A changelog entry exists under the unreleased heading with one bullet per fix.
